This schema will help you present your project clearly and professionally, covering all aspects from concept to technical details and future improvements.

---

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** Portal Patient â€“ Visualisation dâ€™un Carnet de Suivi MÃ©dical
- **Context & Motivation:**
  - Why digitalize patient follow-up?
  - The need for a modern, secure, and user-friendly patient portal.
- **Target Users:**
  - Patients, doctors, and healthcare providers.

---

## 2. Objectives & Features
- **Main Goals:**
  - Centralize patient medical data.
  - Facilitate appointment management.
  - Provide personalized health recommendations.
  - Ensure data privacy and accessibility.
- **Key Features:**
  - Medical record visualization (antecedents, allergies, treatments)
  - Appointment management (upcoming, past)
  - Health recommendations
  - Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
  - Dark/light mode
  - Data confidentiality

---

## 3. Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons:** React Icons
- **Data:** Static JSON files (for demo)
- **Other Tools:** ESLint, PostCSS, TypeScript

---

## 4. Project Structure
- **Root:** Configuration files, build outputs, public assets
- **`src/` Directory:**
  - `app/`: All pages (Home, Dossier, Rendez-vous, Recommandations), layout, global styles
  - `components/`: Reusable UI blocks (Card, Header, Footer, etc.)
  - `data/`: Static JSON data (dossier, rendezvous, recommandations)
- **`public/` Directory:** Images and static assets

---

## 5. Application Flow & User Experience
- **Landing Page:**
  - Welcome message, patient info, next appointment, health tip
- **Navigation:**
  - Header and Footer with quick links
- **Medical Record Page:**
  - Sections for antecedents, allergies, treatments
- **Appointments Page:**
  - Tabs/sections for all, upcoming, and past appointments
- **Recommendations Page:**
  - Health tips grouped by category
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Adapts to all devices
- **Accessibility & UX:**
  - Clear icons, readable fonts, color contrast

---

## 6. Code Architecture & Logic
- **Layout:**
  - `layout.tsx` wraps all pages, injects header/footer, applies global styles
- **Pages:**
  - Each page fetches and displays relevant data using reusable components
- **Components:**
  - `Card`: Consistent UI block
  - `AppointmentCard`, `HealthTipCard`: Specialized content
  - `Header`/`Footer`: Navigation and branding
- **Data:**
  - JSON files for demo; can be replaced by API/database

---

## 7. Security & Privacy
- **Data Confidentiality:**
  - No sensitive data in codebase
  - Ready for secure backend integration
- **Best Practices:**
  - No direct user input stored
  - Static data for demo; real app would use authentication, encryption

---

## 8. Demo & Walkthrough
- **Show the UI:**
  - Home, Dossier, Rendez-vous, Recommandations

  - Add multi-language support
  - Improve accessibility (a11y)

---

## 11. Q&A Preparation
- **Possible Questions:**
  - Why Next.js and Tailwind?
  - How would you scale this for real users?
  - How to ensure data security?
  - How to add new features?
- **Tips:**
  - Be ready to show code snippets
  - Explain your design choices
  - Highlight modularity and extensibility

---

## 12. Conclusion
